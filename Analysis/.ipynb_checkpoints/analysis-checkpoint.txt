When evaluating the effectiveness of using LLMs for scripting potential new seasons or spin-offs of "Succession," the experience has definitely shown both promising capabilities and notable limitations.

The use of LLMs, particularly within a GPT-4 conversational environment, displayed really impressive potential for generating interesting continuations of "Succession," and therefore, other shows as well. This follows with my blog posts nearly 3 months ago. I think that these continuations, if further refined, could theoretically contribute to a breakthrough season. The model demonstrated a strong grasp of the characters' defining traits, spinning these into engaging plot developments and scenes that resonated with the established narrative.

However, challenges were observed particularly when utilizing Jupyter notebooks for this task. The model tended to amplify the most prominent characteristics of characters, relationships, and dynamics without sufficient consideration for narrative continuity. This approach resulted in developments that, while compelling in isolation, might compromise the overall coherence of the series if not carefully integrated.

For the proposed spinoff envisioned as a romantic comedy, the LLM struggled to shift away from the original series' corporate drama theme. Despite intentions to lighten the tone and introduce romantic elements to create a fairly different kind of vibe, the output was still closely tied to the corporate drama genre. To be fair, there could have been a hinting at potential romances such as between characters Harper and Max. 

Overall, while LLMs can creatively extend the narrative threads of established series and even spin them into new directions, their utility in scriptwriting might be best viewed as a supplementary tool rather than a standalone solution (enhance, not replace). The models excel in generating material that can spark ideas or extend plotlines but require human oversight to ensure that these developments are realistic, consistent, and true to the source material's tone and complexity.
