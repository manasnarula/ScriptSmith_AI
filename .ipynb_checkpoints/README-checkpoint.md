In this project, I aim to delve into the capabilities of LLMs in generating compelling storylines for television shows, particularly focusing on "Succession." There will be multiple goals: first, to ask the LLM to list all of the data it needs, and then going out and collecting this data. Then, the goal is to craft the first scene and establish characters and settings for a potential next season using Langchain, while comparing these results to the same thing generated by GPT-4. Second, I plan to conceptualize a spinoff of "Succession," mapping out new plot lines, settings, and characters, and finally, to perform an analysis of these experiments.

The project assesses whether LLMs can maintain narrative continuity and character consistency, drawing from previous seasons and episodes to evaluate the model's understanding of character arcs, developments, and thematic elements. It also investigates the LLM's creativity and originality in introducing new characters, plot twists, and expansions fitting within the established narrative.

Overall, the depth of characterization will be scrutinized to see how well LLMs utilize detailed personality traits and backstories to propel the plot, reflecting true character growth and transformations. Additionally, I will analyze how the model handles the complex narratives, adapts to genre conventions and any feedback I give, avoids biases, and ensure the reality and continuity of proposed storylines. This approach aims to reveal where LLMs excel in creative storytelling and identify areas needing further development.
